I entered it really because I was interested in the brain and interested in language and I thought it would be kind of neat if we could have a computer do something with language, maybe make cartoons speak, something like that. Animation interested me as well. We\u2032re so far from accomplishing anything that would be realistic that was more of a scientific endeavor. I think I\u2032m more of a scientist at heart than, you know, I\u2032m not an entrepreneur, for example.

I didn\u2032t like the library catalog when I was a little kid. And in fact, when I was an intern, I tried to be an intern in my public library in high school and I was rejected because I wasn\u2032t fast enough with filing alphabetically in the card catalog. But I never thought that makes sense. So actually, I always wanted to do a dynamic, smart version of the card catalog, which is what I did in search user interfaces. There\u2032s only one spot in the bookshelf for the book representation. What I focused on was search user interfaces. I wouldn\u2032t say I was the leading person in search, but I was a leader in search user interfaces, which was kind of a hybrid topic at the time because most of the search field was more on algorithms and not so much on the user interface. So I brought those two together. And that was super exciting because the technology or the kind of framework that I worked with, did become the standard for it\u2032s still a standard faceted interaction, what you see on a website when you\u2032re shopping or library catalogs where you can slice and dice and filter in different ways to find the items that you want.

I mean, it was command lined. And then there were Westlaw and these very expensive tools that you could subscribe to, say if you were a lawyer, it was all keyword based. But the interface, there was no thought to the interface. It was just a listing of the output that you got, usually in chronological order. And so there was just no there there. The web changed things, but even with the web, the initial search was, you know, the 10 blue links, which has actually been really hard to improve on. And I would say until now, which we could get to the new moment, you know, Google\u2032s inched towards showing answers to questions. But I remember talking with someone there saying that they were conservative initially because they didn\u2032t want to show incorrect information. And I thought that was the right way to go."

I\u2032m like, no, no. It\u2032s that we didn\u2032t know how to do touchscreens. We didn\u2032t know how to do gestures. Technologically, in the early days, it was a bridge to that. So often the interface we see now is the interface people always wanted, but we didn\u2032t have the technology to support it. And I\u2032d say that\u2032s true for question answering.

We are going to see, instead of people developing visualizations manually, it\u2032s probably going to be done with text interface. And that\u2032s a pretty radical thing to say. And it was a month later that ChatGPT came out. And again, I told the audience at that time that I\u2032ve been in the NLP field for more than 25 years, maybe 30 years, and I\u2032ve never said this is a major change. And I say it now, I was saying it right before ChatGPT, and it is transformational in terms of what we can do with processing language and producing language. It\u2032s not transformational in everything, as some of the hype says. Just like we had a mouse, and then we had a touchscreen. We had keyword query or statistical ranking, or we had these very complex pipelines for making natural language processing systems.

And something that was gestating in my mind as I watched you walk through all the latest research that you could dig up on the human-computer interface and also language and the visual component of people trying to understand complex topics was that we\u2032re probably soon heading into a world where you essentially go to a whiteboard with a model like ChatGPT. So at work, when I need to understand something really complicated or communicate something really complicated or collaborate with someone on a really complicated problem, we go to the whiteboard. It\u2032s sort of the best environment to do this. What that means is you have all the affordances of language, just speaking one-on-one, and you also have this whiteboard next to you that you can diagram things, correct things, point things out visually. And so it\u2032s sort of maximum bandwidth, and it feels like the most comfortable way to navigate really complicated things. I think that we\u2032ve clearly gone way down the road of the chat side of this, the language side of this. You can interact with ChatGPT and talk about really complicated things, maybe even solve problems together. But there isn\u2032t yet that whiteboard, but I think it\u2032s safe to say that we\u2032re headed towards AI whiteboards. And you have been grappling with the nuts and bolts of how you communicate both visually and with language, and how the two play off each other, sometimes synergistically. I\u2032d love to pick your brain just on what it\u2032s going to mean heading into a world of AI whiteboards. And of course, it goes way beyond whiteboards.

And so, I don\u2032t know that it\u2032s capable of doing that. Yet, I listened to the interview with Sergey, and he, here at Berkeley, Sergey Levin on reinforcement learning, and he kind of pointed out that it\u2032s not using technology to kind of do future sequencing.

Because the information visualization community focuses reasonably on how to visualize data, how to visualize information. And there\u2032s been less of a focus of how does language or text overlay on that or interact with that. And I mentioned this in our earlier conversation with John, that for many semesters or many years, I was teaching natural language processing in the fall and information visualization in the spring, and thinking about what sort of information can be represented in each modality. And can you convert one to the other directly? And I think the answer is no. They show or they explain different visuals, explain different things than text. And if you think about the movie versus the book, that\u2032s like the best example. There are some books written to be made into movies. You think about the Harry Potter series, for example, and they\u2032re very true to the original, I think. But there\u2032s a lot that don\u2032t transfer so well. And a lot of it is about interiority and mood and things like that, that mood is expressed differently with words than with images. And they complement each other, of course, which is why the soundtrack is so important for the film. When you become a novelist, you don\u2032t have to write pictures in your novels anymore."

I think it\u2032s really important that we understand how, and this is the human computer interaction, the HCI side of the AI HCI coin as I think about them, understanding how people understand things so that we know what to tell the computers to do. Right now we have people designing visualizations and they don\u2032t necessarily know how to put the design into language and neither will probably the computer. Or if the computer does know, we at least need to know how to assess if it did a good job or not, which I think we need to do more work on."

We don\u2032t know exactly what they\u2032ll be, but if we follow the trend with GPT-3 solely on the language side, I wonder what kind of capabilities even are there to acquire on the visual side. Something that comes to my mind is simplifying something visually. Sometimes as simple as underlining something can make something salient that helps explain the whole.

And so really what you want to do is generate your own text, but you want it to be accurate. It\u2032s based on the text of the paper. So we are actually looking to see if the latest models can help with the automation of that task. But going back to a point you made earlier about creativity or new synthesis with these models, I think someone who was hosted earlier on this podcast pointed out just even the avocado sofa is a synergy of image.

And of course the answer is neither works perfectly, and people who are practitioners use a blend of both. But it seems now, as I said about Ask Jeeves, what people really want to do is just use language to say, do this, do that, and have the program get written. And then point and use gestures in the interface to tweak it a bit, this multimodality. And again, there are tools to do that, but they\u2032re just not perfect. And the more that the algorithms improve, like with ChatGPT, the more effectively we\u2032ll be able to help people design visualizations where they don\u2032t have to do a lot of coding.

People doing driving cars, self-driving cars have a bit of a head start, mainly on seeing how hard the problem is.

So HCI shows us how to study people and how they work and how they work with technology. So using HCI methods to deeply study that and in different contexts. It\u2032s different in a medical setting. There\u2032s a colleague that, Ilifar Salehi here at the iSchool at Berkeley, who is looking at machine translation in a medical setting and when information is not translated correctly and how that can adversely impact marginalized communities when the translation isn\u2032t really the right thing and how to get the context right. So I think each setting is probably going to need some specialized research. And furthermore, one of your podcasts is about how do people inject poison, the training data and so on. And so you're going to have to be very careful about attacks like that. It\u2032s not a field that I\u2032m in. Perhaps it will be important to have diversification in the different models so that there\u2032s ways to check them, make sure that they are safe and appropriate for a particular use. I think the techniques of HCI and ethnography really work independent of the context. It\u2032s not AI. People in AI don\u2032t necessarily want to sit down with people, humans, and see their details and what they do and so on. But that\u2032s the only way to have really working systems that are good for society."

Don\u2032t do the trendiest thing for its own sake. It\u2032s definitely a big question mark right now for research universities and AI labs and other research groups. If there\u2032s a big microscope that some people have and you don\u2032t, how do you compete? There\u2032s open source effort, things that Hugging Face and others are doing. I think the US government is interested as well in giving everybody a microscope, meaning these large language models and the ability to run them. I think that people are very aware of that issue. But then if you want to do advanced research on this, you get brilliant people like Agent Choi at University of Washington and AI2 that are showing that you can do a lot with much less. You don\u2032t need to have all these parameters and so on. That\u2032s where the university can help. The university people are also going to be looking at how do you save energy. Well, I mean, so is industry. But how do you save energy when you use these? It\u2032s very wasteful right now. These are all great areas for research. Of course, understanding what these models are doing, understanding the mind better, can they help us understand the mind in some way? I\u2032m sure psychologists are thinking about that. There\u2032s work already, I\u2032ve seen work in linguistics on say using GANs and adversarial methods to model linguistics in other species. There\u2032s always more research questions. If you\u2032re interested in being in industry and business, then go do that. If you\u2032re interested in research, then find a problem that just really interests you because that\u2032s how you can finish your PhD."

Like who\u2032s going to win an election by looking at this chart? And we actually found surprisingly that the text did not influence the prediction all that much. In this case, where people relied more on the visual input. But in another study we did where it was more what are you taking away information-wise, then the way the text was used did have an influence. So what we really need to do is understand this interplay more. I\u2032m just very excited about that topic. I know it\u2032s kind of a niche topic, but it\u2032s what interests me."
