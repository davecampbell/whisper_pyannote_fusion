But I never thought that makes sense. So actually, I always wanted to do a dynamic, smart version of the card catalog, which is what I did in search user interfaces. There\u2032s only one spot in the bookshelf for the book representation. What I focused on was search user interfaces. I wouldn\u2032t say I was the leading person in search, but I was a leader in search user interfaces, which was kind of a hybrid topic at the time because most of the search field was more on algorithms and not so much on the user interface. So I brought those two together and that was super exciting because the technology or the kind of framework that I advocated for and showed empirically worked did become the standard for it\u2032s still a standard faceted interaction like what you see on a website when you\u2032re shopping or library catalogs where you can slice and dice and filter in different ways to find the items that you want. Getting that interface to work well was a big challenge and that was sort of the breakthrough.",

And I have some old screenshots of it. It just didn't work. It's like someone saying, oh, people like the mouse, but now we have touchscreens and their taste of change. I'm like, no, no, it's that we didn't know how to do touchscreens. We didn't know how to do gestures. Technologically, in the early days, it was a bridge to that. So often the interface we see now is the interface people always wanted, but we didn't have the technology to support it. And I'd say that's true for question answering. Now, there's an exception for scholars and people doing research who want to see the documents and primary resources, but that's always been a minority.",

We are going to see instead of people developing visualizations manually, it's probably going to be done with text interface. And that's a pretty radical thing to say. And it was a month later that Chat GPT came out. And again, I told the audience at that time that I've been in the NLP field for more than 25 years, maybe 30 years. And I've never said this is a major change. And I say it now, I was saying it right before Chat GPT. And it is transformational in terms of what we can do with processing language and producing language. It's not transformational in everything, as some of the hype says. Just like we had a mouse and then we had a touchscreen, we had keyword query or statistical ranking, or we had these very complex pipelines for making natural language processing systems. And now it's kind of one relatively simple architecture that does everything as opposed to specific algorithms. And it's kind of head spinning, really.",

So at work, when I need to understand something really complicated or communicate something really complicated or collaborate with someone on a really complicated problem, we go to the whiteboard. It's sort of the best environment to do this. What that means is you have all the affordances of language just speaking one on one. And you also have this whiteboard next to you that you can diagram things, correct things, point things out visually. And so it's sort of maximum bandwidth and it feels like the most comfortable way to navigate really complicated things. I think that we've clearly gone way down the road of the chat side of this, the language side of this. You can interact with Chat GPT and talk about really complicated things, maybe even solve problems together. But there isn't yet that whiteboard. But I think it's coming. And we saw a hint of it with the demonstration video of GPT-4. So it seems safe to say that we're headed towards AI whiteboards. And you have been grappling with the nuts and bolts of how you communicate both visually and with language and how the two play off each other, sometimes synergistically. Love to pick your brain just on what it's going to mean heading into a world of AI whiteboards. And of course, it goes way beyond whiteboards. It could show you arbitrary images, videos it generates, things it finds from the Internet and actually points things out and illustrates it.",

And I mentioned this in our earlier conversation with John that for many semesters or many years, I was teaching natural language processing in the fall and information visualization in the spring and thinking about what sort of information can be represented in each modality and can you convert one to the other directly? And I think the answer is no. They show or they explain different things, visuals explain different things than text. And if you think about the movie versus the book, that's like the best example. There are some books written to be made into movies. You think about the Harry Potter series, for example, and they're very true to the original, I think, but there's a lot that don't transfer so well. And a lot of it is about interiority and mood and things like that, that mood is expressed differently with words than with images. And they complement each other, of course, which is why the soundtrack is so important for the film. When you become a grown-up, you don't have pictures in your novels anymore.",

And the more that the algorithms improve, like with ChatGPT, the more effectively we'll be able to help people design visualizations where they don't have to do a lot of coding. It's again, because it works, this general purpose tool that we're talking about as a side effect of being, you know, produce the next word, it's able to do all these other things that I think we don't understand why, but that includes writing code or, you know, being smart about adding things into code and so on. It wasn't designed for that, but it seems like it will be very effective at making it easier to design visualizations. The problem is, will it design good visualizations?

But you know, each time people start to make some progress on that, then a new model comes out that's even harder to understand because the scale is so much larger and we're not good at thinking at very large scale. So I think it's going to take years before we understand what's going on. I don't think it's cognition. I'm very skeptical about that. It's really, I mean, you know, we get into philosophy and the Chinese room, that's an old John Searle thought experiment. I mean, it's unfortunate, I guess, the use of Chinese in that particular example, but the idea being if you replace each piece of your brain with a little like component, electronic component, and you eventually replace every piece, is it still a brain? You know, are you still thinking? There's philosophy thought experiments. You might want to say, oh, well, this model that's basically just a bunch of numbers, a bunch of weights that have been trained is thinking, because you can say that about the brain, but you know, I'm not convinced. I think there's a lot more going on in the brain than is going on in these models. I agree with you. They're very good at mimicking, you know, at producing language. And because language is distinctly human, it feels, you know, to a lot of people like it's human. When people are driving in their cars, they name their car, even old cars, they had no electronic components. They would name their cars, they would anthropomorphize their cars. They feel a part of their cars. This is what we do with technology. People are going to get used to it and then it's going to become old news. And I think it's great that we don't have to write all these tokenizers. The LP pipeline didn't work. It was a mess. And there's always new problems and new questions to investigate from a research perspective. Researchers will not be out of business. Of course, it does raise even more societal issues and dangers because of the ability to fake information, to spread misinformation, and for people to not know what's real and what's true. So we're living through a very chaotic moment right now. I think we're going to look back 10 years from now and we're going to go, wow, that was a chaotic time in technology. That was a chaotic time politically. And hopefully we'll be able to look back and say, thank goodness we made it through. Okay. I'm optimistic we will.",

There\u2032s a colleague that Ilifar Salehi here at the iSchool at Berkeley who is looking at machine translation in a medical setting and when information is not translated correctly and how that can adversely impact marginalized communities when the translation isn\u2032t really the right thing and how to get the context right. So I think each setting is probably going to need some specialized research. And, you know, furthermore, one of your podcasts is about how do people inject poison, the training data and so on. And so you're going to have to be very careful about attacks like that. It\u2032s not a field that I\u2032m in. Perhaps it will be important to have diversification in the different models so that there\u2032s ways to check them, make sure that they are safe and appropriate for a particular use. I think the techniques of HCI and ethnography really work independent of the context. It\u2032s not AI. You know, people in AI don\u2032t necessarily want to sit down with people, humans, and see their details and what they do and so on. But that\u2032s the only way to have really working systems that are good for society.",

But then if you want to do advanced research on this, you get brilliant people like Agent Choi at the University of Washington and AI2 that are showing that you can do a lot with much less. You don't need to have all these parameters and so on. And that's where the university can help. The university people are also going to be looking at how do you save energy? Well, I mean, so is industry, but how do you save energy when you use these? It's very wasteful right now. These are all great areas for research. And of course, understanding what these models are doing, understanding the mind better, can they help us understand the mind in some way? I'm sure psychologists are thinking about that. There's work already. I've seen work in linguistics on, say, using GANs and adversarial methods to model linguistics in other species. So there's always more research questions. And if you're interested in being in industry and business, then go do that. And if you're interested in research, then find a problem that just really interests you, because that's how you can finish your PhD.",
