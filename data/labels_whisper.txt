0.0	21.86	 Hey, what′s up everyone, this is Sam. In today′s interview, part of our guest host series, you′ll hear a conversation led by longtime friend of the show, John Bohannon, Director of Science at Primer AI and former journalist for publications like Science Magazine, Wired, and others. I′m sure you′re going to enjoy this conversation, so let′s jump in. Peace.
31.8	34.42	 Good morning, Marti. Good morning, John.
34.86	40.0	 So we are just a few miles away from each other across a body of water. I′m in San
40.0	45.14	 Francisco. You′re across the bay in Berkeley at your office at University of California,
45.22	50.62	 Berkeley, where you are the head of the School of Information and a computer scientist who′s
50.62	52.72	 been in the game for many decades. That′s right.
52.94	57.16	 So I′m excited to finally do this interview because it′s been almost a year in the making.
57.64	63.36	 We had a great interview here on the show with Orin Etzioni, former head of AI2 in
63.36	67.76	 Seattle. After that interview, I asked Orin who would be a really good guest who would
67.76	71.92	 have something worth sharing with the audience, and you were the first person he said.
72.3	76.58	 Well, I listened to that interview, and it was an excellent interview. Orin is so articulate,
76.78	81.56	 and you′re a great interviewer. I′m really honored to be here, and I′m really honored
81.56	84.46	 that Orin thought it was worthwhile to recommend me.
84.72	87.24	 You don′t do that many interviews, from what I gather.
88.0	93.74	 No, I don′t. I′m a little bit camera shy, even though I do have to be on camera a lot.
93.94	99.44	 Also, I like to be pretty careful about what I say, kind of more from the scientist′s
99.44	105.76	 perspective. I think Orin is really great at linking science to business and where technology
105.76	108.94	 is going. But yeah, I guess I′m just a little bit shy that way.
109.26	114.08	 And that brings me to kind of the big story here. For those listening at home, Marty and I had a
114.32	118.58	 chat recently in advance of this interview just to talk about what we might talk about.
119.24	124.96	 And something really striking was that there′s this moment, let′s call it the chat GPT moment,
125.26	130.4	 it′s really the large language model moment, where artificial intelligence seems to be at
130.4	136.92	 some kind of inflection point. And you told me about your long career and how you have kind of
136.92	141.68	 seen these moments before, and you′re more cautious about speaking publicly to add to the
141.68	147.4	 hype cycle because it′s often disappointing and often regrettable. It′s easy to say things that
147.4	152.28	 you later think were overhyped. Why is this different? Yeah, so I have seen a lot over the
152.28	158.34	 years. I′ve been, I′d say, primarily in natural language processing, that part of AI. And it′s
158.34	164.38	 just been a slog in terms of making progress and having machines be able to process language the
164.38	168.52	 way people do. I entered it really because I was interested in the brain and interested in language
168.6	173.56	 and I thought it would be kind of neat if we could have a computer do something with language, maybe
173.56	179.24	 make cartoons speak, something like that. Animation interested me as well. We′re so far
179.24	185.04	 from accomplishing anything that would be realistic that was more of a scientific endeavor.
185.24	189.16	 I think I′m more of a scientist at heart than, you know, I′m not an entrepreneur, for example.
189.56	197.96	 So I′ve seen claims, for example, I remember, I guess in the early 90s, there was this claim that
197.96	204.0	 it was going to transform everything. And it was just so obviously ludicrous. But you also see,
204.1	208.68	 you know, I remember when WebFountain came out with IBM and that was going to transform everything.
209.16	213.58	 And, you know, it′s very much... Or how about IBM Watson? Well, you know, Watson was a special case
213.58	219.08	 in that it was amazing what they did with Jeopardy and we can talk about that a bit more. But then
219.08	224.32	 there was the claim that it was going to transform healthcare. And again, there was no path from that
224.32	229.78	 to directly to healthcare being transformed in the immediate future. So I learned that if you
229.78	234.6	 read the New York Times regularly, as I do, technology is in the business section as opposed
234.6	240.6	 to the science section. And that′s kind of how technology is talked about in, at least in the US.
240.98	245.52	 And of course, there is scientific reporting on it. And your podcast, I think, is wonderful in that
245.52	249.84	 it goes into a lot of technical details, which is really exciting. But there′s always the business
249.84	254.96	 angle when it comes to technology, even when I started out in the late 80s and, you know,
255.2	261.18	 at most there were PCs. Well, in the late 80s and into the 90s, you became one of the main
261.18	266.6	 researchers in search. And search really defined the era that I think is probably coming to a
266.6	273.6	 close, the Google era, the era of search, search driving everything. And so you did really see the
273.6	278.7	 business side of your research explode and change the world. Are we in a moment like that now?
278.84	283.7	 Well, I wouldn′t mind talking about search for a few minutes since it is close to my heart. I mean,
283.78	287.7	 I was interested in search because I wanted to be able to find things. I didn′t like the library
287.7	292.68	 catalog when I was a little kid. And in fact, when I was an intern, I tried to be an intern in my
292.68	297.22	 public library in high school and I was rejected because I wasn′t fast enough with filing
297.22	301.3	 alphabetically in the card catalog. But I never thought that makes sense. So actually, I always
301.3	306.72	 wanted to do a dynamic, smart version of the card catalog, which is what I did in search user
306.74	312.06	 interfaces. There′s only one spot in the bookshelf for the book representation. What I focused on
312.06	316.58	 was search user interfaces. I wouldn′t say I was the leading person in search, but I was a leader
316.58	321.52	 in search user interfaces, which was kind of a hybrid topic at the time because most of the
321.52	325.96	 search field was more on algorithms and not so much on the user interface. So I brought those
325.96	333.96	 two together. And that was super exciting because the technology or the kind of framework that I
334.18	339.06	 worked with, did become the standard for it′s still a standard faceted interaction, what you
339.06	344.94	 see on a website when you′re shopping or library catalogs where you can slice and dice and filter
344.94	350.7	 in different ways to find the items that you want. Getting that interface to work well was a big
350.7	354.56	 challenge and that was sort of the breakthrough. What was the big problem with search interfaces
354.56	360.6	 before you got into the game? Well, when I got into the game, most software did not have search
360.96	365.88	 full stop. I mean, if you had an application, you couldn′t search for material within it.
366.12	371.22	 It was just rare. It just didn′t happen much. When I got into the game, library catalogs were
371.22	377.3	 searched by saying, you know, PN Bonneman comma J to find the personal name of the author. I mean,
377.32	383.84	 it was command lined. And then there were Westlaw and these very expensive tools that you could
383.84	389.14	 subscribe to, say if you were a lawyer, it was all keyword based. But the interface, there was no
389.14	393.6	 thought to the interface. It was just a listing of the output that you got, usually in chronological
393.6	398.52	 order. And so there was just no there there. The web changed things, but even with the web,
398.58	402.68	 the initial search was, you know, the 10 blue links, which has actually been really hard to
402.68	407.62	 improve on. And I would say until now, which we could get to the new moment, you know,
407.62	411.68	 Google′s inched towards showing answers to questions. But I remember talking with someone
411.68	414.68	 there saying that they were conservative initially because they didn′t want to show incorrect
414.68	418.6	 information. And I thought that was the right way to go. Isn′t that one of the big shifts?
418.64	424.78	 It′s like once upon a time, the purpose of search was to find a document or find a resource. But
424.78	430.26	 nowadays you want the answer to a question. It′s almost a shift in intention. Actually, I speak to
430.26	436.04	 that. I think people always wanted to ask questions, but it wasn′t possible to get an answer. So we
436.04	441.0	 were just adapting to a bad system. Well, I always like to use the example of this old website called
441.0	446.08	 Ask Jeeves, which was an attempt to allow people to ask questions and get answers. And it didn′t
446.08	450.48	 work because the technology didn′t work, but people kept using it and always said they liked
450.48	456.0	 it because they liked the idea of being able to ask a question and get an answer. And I have some
456.0	461.72	 old screenshots of it. It just didn′t work. It′s like someone saying, oh, people like the mouse,
461.84	466.18	 but now we have touchscreens and their tastes have changed. I′m like, no, no. It′s that we didn′t
466.18	470.74	 know how to do touchscreens. We didn′t know how to do gestures. Technologically, in the early days,
470.74	477.52	 it was a bridge to that. So often the interface we see now is the interface people always wanted,
477.68	481.6	 but we didn′t have the technology to support it. And I′d say that′s true for question answering.
481.96	487.24	 Now, there′s an exception for scholars and people doing research who want to see the documents and
487.24	492.08	 primary resources, but that′s always been a minority. Yeah. So that brings us to the current
492.08	496.82	 moment where the machine behind your screen that′s going to try and answer your questions
496.88	502.18	 is suddenly, and I really mean suddenly, able to answer it almost like a human it feels like at
502.18	508.36	 times. I agree. I think it′s a sea change. So I gave a keynote talk in October to the Information
508.36	514.28	 Visualization Society, the IEEE Society. And in that talk, part of what I did was talked about,
514.6	519.7	 you know, this is coming. We are going to see, instead of people developing visualizations
519.7	524.32	 manually, it′s probably going to be done with text interface. And that′s a pretty radical
524.32	529.94	 thing to say. And it was a month later that ChatGPT came out. And again, I told the audience
529.94	535.74	 at that time that I′ve been in the NLP field for more than 25 years, maybe 30 years, and I′ve never
535.74	541.54	 said this is a major change. And I say it now, I was saying it right before ChatGPT,
541.84	547.98	 and it is transformational in terms of what we can do with processing language and producing
547.98	553.5	 language. It′s not transformational in everything, as some of the hype says. Just like we had a
553.5	560.06	 mouse, and then we had a touchscreen. We had keyword query or statistical ranking, or we had
560.06	565.24	 these very complex pipelines for making natural language processing systems. And now it′s kind
565.24	571.94	 of one relatively simple architecture that does everything as opposed to specific algorithms.
572.36	578.58	 And it′s kind of head spinning, really. Well, simple schematically, but very complicated in
578.58	581.64	 terms of what structure might be hidden in all those billions of neurons.
582.14	585.9	 Yeah, it′s simple in terms of what the people have to do and complex in terms of what the
585.9	590.18	 program is doing. I actually have an example that I was just trying last night, because
590.18	595.74	 in the same talk, I gave an example of comparatives being very difficult to process automatically.
595.94	596.4	 What′s a comparative?
596.84	602.44	 So if you have, say, a review of a camera and someone in their regular casual language is
602.44	611.18	 saying, oh, the DLSR has a wider angle, but the pixels are not as crisply retained. What are they
611.18	616.5	 saying is better than what? There′s a lot implied there, and there′s an implicit comparison
616.5	621.84	 between kind of the overall merits of some camera and then these specific components,
622.36	626.78	 the pixels and so on. And I used that as an example of something that would be very hard to
626.78	631.78	 write an algorithm to process automatically. And one of the reviewers of the paper that I wrote
631.78	635.64	 said, yeah, that was true, but I just put this in ChatGPT and it worked really well.
635.88	642.64	 So last night, I put all these super complex descriptions of reviews of cameras in ChatGPT,
642.74	647.3	 and it did an amazing job of saying what was being compared to what. But I still say that
647.3	652.58	 it would be very hard to write an algorithm to process the language to do that. It′s a general
652.58	656.46	 purpose tool that does that as a side effect of what else it does.
656.86	659.26	 Yeah, it′s sort of an all-purpose reasoning machine.
659.56	661.74	 It′s something. I don′t know what it is.
662.88	669.0	 So I watched your keynote and found it really, really remarkable. And something that was
669.0	674.1	 gestating in my mind as I watched you walk through all the latest research that you could
674.1	680.86	 dig up on the human-computer interface and also language and the visual component of people trying
680.86	686.7	 to understand complex topics was that we′re probably soon heading into a world where you
686.7	693.64	 essentially go to a whiteboard with a model like ChatGPT. So at work, when I need to understand
693.64	698.58	 something really complicated or communicate something really complicated or collaborate
698.58	703.36	 with someone on a really complicated problem, we go to the whiteboard. It′s sort of the best
703.36	706.82	 environment to do this. What that means is you have all the affordances of language,
707.2	711.02	 just speaking one-on-one, and you also have this whiteboard next to you that you can
711.18	716.56	 diagram things, correct things, point things out visually. And so it′s sort of maximum bandwidth,
716.84	722.7	 and it feels like the most comfortable way to navigate really complicated things. I think that
722.7	728.04	 we′ve clearly gone way down the road of the chat side of this, the language side of this.
728.5	732.08	 You can interact with ChatGPT and talk about really complicated things,
732.26	741.0	 maybe even solve problems together. But there isn′t yet that whiteboard, but I think it′s
741.0	747.18	 safe to say that we′re headed towards AI whiteboards. And you have been grappling with
747.18	754.58	 the nuts and bolts of how you communicate both visually and with language, and how the two play
754.58	759.92	 off each other, sometimes synergistically. I′d love to pick your brain just on what it′s going
759.92	764.6	 to mean heading into a world of AI whiteboards. And of course, it goes way beyond whiteboards.
764.66	769.6	 It can show you arbitrary images, videos it generates, things it finds from the internet,
769.6	772.68	 and actually points things out and illustrates it.
773.02	778.26	 Yeah, I think that there′s a lot of potential for these tools, these large language model-based
778.26	783.64	 tools, to be collaborators in thinking. I think that′s what you mean by the whiteboard.
783.66	783.98	 Yeah.
784.14	790.6	 But after I had done my keynote, I did actually ask ChatGPT to make an outline of a talk on the
790.6	795.04	 subject that I had selected. And it was not very creative. It said things that made sense,
795.04	799.62	 but it would have been, I guess, somebody who kind of knew the field, but was not
799.62	804.76	 innovating, was not seeing the future. And so, I don′t know that it′s capable of doing that.
805.18	810.78	 Yet, I listened to the interview with Sergey, and he, here at Berkeley, Sergey Levin on
810.78	815.32	 reinforcement learning, and he kind of pointed out that it′s not using technology to
815.32	819.76	 kind of do future sequencing. But they′re working on it, I guess, or they might work on it.
819.94	823.22	 Yeah. No doubt the human is going to have to do most of the intellectual heavy lifting
823.38	829.84	 in the beginning. I mean, what is it going to mean for information sharing and explaining when we can
829.84	834.44	 use something as powerful as ChatGPT in the language regime, also in the visual regime?
834.96	839.08	 Yeah. So, and referring back to that keynote a bit, the topic is the intersection of language
839.08	844.22	 and visualization. Because the information visualization community focuses reasonably
844.22	848.38	 on how to visualize data, how to visualize information. And there′s been less of a
848.38	853.94	 focus of how does language or text overlay on that or interact with that. And I mentioned this
853.94	859.04	 in our earlier conversation with John, that for many semesters or many years, I was teaching
859.04	863.38	 natural language processing in the fall and information visualization in the spring,
863.72	868.84	 and thinking about what sort of information can be represented in each modality. And can you
868.84	873.78	 convert one to the other directly? And I think the answer is no. They show or they explain different
874.32	878.78	 visuals, explain different things than text. And if you think about the movie versus the book,
878.86	883.34	 that′s like the best example. There are some books written to be made into movies. You think
883.34	887.66	 about the Harry Potter series, for example, and they′re very true to the original, I think. But
887.66	894.04	 there′s a lot that don′t transfer so well. And a lot of it is about interiority and mood and things
894.04	898.06	 like that, that mood is expressed differently with words than with images. And they complement
898.06	902.76	 each other, of course, which is why the soundtrack is so important for the film. When you become a
902.76	904.38	 novelist, you don′t have to write pictures in your novels anymore.
904.6	909.0	 Except you pointed out in your keynote that really lovely classic book by Scott McCloud
909.0	914.72	 on how comic books work. You pointed out that there′s a method to it. There′s a kind of
914.72	919.42	 balance between the visual and the language. And sometimes one can do most of the work and
919.42	921.6	 sometimes the other. Couldn′t a model learn to do that?
921.9	925.78	 Oh, well, could a model learn to do that? I mean, I think you could give it instructions to learn to
925.78	930.1	 do that. I think right now what I′m interested in is how do people understand these things
930.24	937.04	 and then how best to express information so that you promote understanding and you don′t promote
937.04	941.6	 misinformation or you try to combat misinformation. I think it′s really important that we understand
941.6	947.98	 how, and this is the human computer interaction, the HCI side of the AI HCI coin as I think about
947.98	952.84	 them, understanding how people understand things so that we know what to tell the computers to do.
953.14	957.54	 Right now we have people designing visualizations and they don′t necessarily know how to put the
957.54	962.6	 design into language and neither will probably the computer. Or if the computer does know,
962.66	966.64	 we at least need to know how to assess if it did a good job or not, which I think we need to do more
966.64	972.06	 work on. Yeah. But just to go out one step out onto the limb, I know you′re very wary of speculation,
972.44	977.12	 but this one feels like a safe speculation. I think that there are going to be emergent
977.12	982.9	 capabilities with multimodal models that can deal both with the visual and the language side.
983.22	988.72	 We don′t know exactly what they′ll be, but if we follow the trend with GPT-3 solely on the
988.72	994.5	 language side, I wonder what kind of capabilities even are there to acquire on the visual side.
994.96	1000.3	 Something that comes to my mind is simplifying something visually. Sometimes as simple as
1000.3	1005.36	 underlining something can make something salient that helps explain the whole.
1005.62	1010.44	 You have a project called ScholarPHY with Andrew Head at Berkeley. Is he a student of yours?
1010.52	1013.9	 He was a student and a postdoc, and now he′s a professor at UPenn.
1014.2	1018.9	 And it was a collaboration with people at AI2, hence the Oren reference.
1019.18	1024.86	 I saw a breakdown of the project. It′s so neat. One of the really neat insights is when you read
1024.86	1028.9	 something that′s got a lot of complicated mathematics in it, your brain is doing a ton
1028.9	1034.4	 of work behind the scenes. If you had a better interface, for example, click on a variable in
1034.4	1038.92	 a formula and just have it automatically pop out and say, this is what that represents.
1038.92	1042.12	 So you offload some of that cognitive work you have to do.
1042.52	1045.26	 I wonder if those kind of skills could be learned.
1045.76	1049.24	 I hope so. And you mean the skills of visually showing the information?
1049.66	1053.64	 Yeah. All those tricks that a good visual explainer just knows how to do.
1054.02	1059.16	 Well, I am optimistic that these new models will make that automation task that we had
1059.16	1065.28	 more effective. We worked on algorithms to do it automatically, but PDFs are really tricky
1065.28	1069.56	 to process if you′re looking at the image level. And it′s very hard to find definitions
1069.56	1074.26	 within a scientific paper because not everything is defined in a crisp way. And so really what you
1074.26	1078.94	 want to do is generate your own text, but you want it to be accurate. It′s based on the text
1078.94	1083.16	 of the paper. So we are actually looking to see if the latest models can help with the automation
1083.16	1089.22	 of that task. But going back to a point you made earlier about creativity or new synthesis with
1089.22	1093.66	 these models, I think someone who was hosted earlier on this podcast pointed out just even
1093.66	1100.32	 the avocado sofa is a synergy of image. A human had to ask the query, but then the system was able
1100.32	1106.4	 to blend these images together into something new. Although it doesn′t blend well if they don′t go
1106.4	1111.64	 well together. In case anyone listening doesn′t know what the avocado chair is, this was the sort
1111.64	1117.4	 of amazing DALI moment. So the DALI model came with a paper, and in that paper they had some
1117.4	1122.34	 images as examples of what it could do. And one of them was make a chair made of an avocado,
1122.34	1127.38	 something like that. And it was sort of amazingly convincingly good. It really was.
1127.52	1130.76	 Yeah, although they are a little cherry picked because if you try to combine two things that
1130.76	1135.24	 don′t often go well together or don′t appear together, it doesn′t work, or at least it didn′t
1135.24	1136.64	 work when I was playing. It′ll flub it.
1136.92	1142.72	 Yeah. But still, it′s a great example of synergy with these tools. And what I noted in the keynote
1142.72	1147.86	 was that co-pilot these systems that aid in programming rather than, you know, there′s
1147.86	1153.08	 been a long debate in HCI about when you′re developing, say, a user interface or doing data
1153.08	1158.28	 analysis, should it be a command line or should it be a graphical user interface, a GUI? And of
1158.28	1163.28	 course the answer is neither works perfectly, and people who are practitioners use a blend of both.
1163.44	1168.86	 But it seems now, as I said about Ask Jeeves, what people really want to do is just use language to
1168.86	1173.76	 say, do this, do that, and have the program get written. And then point and use gestures in the
1173.76	1180.28	 interface to tweak it a bit, this multimodality. And again, there are tools to do that, but they′re
1180.28	1188.12	 just not perfect. And the more that the algorithms improve, like with ChatGPT, the more effectively
1188.12	1193.58	 we′ll be able to help people design visualizations where they don′t have to do a lot of coding.
1193.96	1199.7	 It′s again, because it works, this general purpose tool that we′re talking about, as a side effect
1199.88	1203.7	 of being, you know, produce the next word, it′s able to do all these other things,
1203.78	1208.76	 and I think we don′t understand why, but that includes writing code or, you know, being smart
1208.76	1213.92	 about adding things into code and so on. It wasn′t designed for that, but it seems like it will be
1213.92	1219.54	 very effective at making it easier to design visualizations. The problem is, will it design
1219.54	1223.38	 good visualizations? And, you know, that′s where we still have the human component.
1223.8	1228.08	 Well, I think the safe way to use these things is to generate first drafts and iterate,
1228.1	1232.48	 but that you have to be the human editor who makes the final call and do the driving.
1232.86	1238.42	 Yeah, I agree. The work that we all do in the viz field can help determine what makes a good
1238.42	1243.02	 design, help give guidelines. We do research, empirical research, and then we produce guidelines
1243.02	1244.84	 for practitioners to follow.
1245.2	1250.96	 So, bringing this all back to this moment, you′re a natural language processing practitioner. You′ve
1250.96	1255.94	 spent years trying to teach machines to do useful things with language. And here we are,
1255.94	1261.44	 in a moment where, I don′t know about you, but I feel like, wow, a lot of the things we solved,
1262.22	1267.6	 you don′t have to worry about anymore. Just sort of more and more and more of all that hard,
1267.72	1274.82	 algorithmic, hand-rolled feature engineering world is getting eaten up by large language
1274.82	1281.5	 models that can simply speak. And they seem to have cognitive abilities that we would never have
1281.5	1283.26	 dreamed would be in a machine.
1283.46	1287.68	 Well, I′m not going there with you on the cognitive abilities that I′m very cautious
1287.68	1288.56	 and skeptical about.
1288.58	1289.76	 What should we call them? Behaviors?
1290.34	1295.2	 I guess I don′t have my favorite word for it yet. Capabilities. It works a lot better than it used
1295.2	1299.34	 to work. There′s a lot of people looking into, you know, why does it work? But, you know, each
1299.34	1303.92	 time people start to make some progress on that, then a new model comes out that′s even harder
1303.92	1308.3	 to understand because the scale is so much larger and we′re not good at thinking at a very large
1308.3	1313.1	 scale. So, I think it′s going to take years before we understand what′s going on. I don′t
1313.1	1318.52	 think it′s cognition. I′m very skeptical about that. It′s really, I mean, you know, we get into
1318.52	1324.58	 philosophy and the Chinese room, that′s an old John Searle thought experiment. I mean, it′s
1324.58	1329.74	 unfortunate, I guess, the use of Chinese in that particular example. But the idea being if you
1329.74	1335.24	 replace each piece of your brain with a little, like, component, electronic component, and you
1335.24	1339.14	 eventually replace every piece, is it still a brain? You know, are you still thinking? There′s
1339.24	1344.72	 philosophy thought experiments. You might want to say, oh, well, this model that′s basically just
1344.72	1348.86	 a bunch of numbers, a bunch of weights that have been trained, is thinking because you can say that
1348.86	1353.14	 about the brain. But, you know, I′m not convinced. I think there′s a lot more going on in the brain
1353.14	1356.96	 than is going on in these models. I agree with you. They′re very good at mimicking, you know,
1356.96	1361.92	 at producing language and because language is distinctly human, it feels, you know, to a lot
1361.92	1367.1	 of people like it′s human. When people are driving in their cars, they name their car, even old cars
1367.1	1370.8	 that had no electronic components. They would name their cars. They would anthropomorphize their
1370.8	1375.26	 cars. They feel a part of their cars. This is what we do with technology. People are going to get
1375.26	1379.7	 used to it and then it′s going to become old news. And I think it′s great that we don′t have to
1379.7	1385.48	 write all these tokenizers. The LP pipeline didn′t work. It was a mess. And there′s always new
1385.48	1390.12	 problems and new questions to investigate from a research perspective. Researchers will not be out
1390.12	1397.46	 of business. Of course, it does raise even more societal issues and dangers because of the ability
1397.46	1403.34	 to fake information, to spread misinformation, and for people to not know what′s real and what′s
1403.34	1407.28	 true. So we′re living through a very chaotic moment right now. I think we′re going to look
1407.28	1411.22	 back 10 years from now and we′re going to go, wow, that was a chaotic time in technology. That
1411.22	1415.92	 was a chaotic time politically. And hopefully we′ll be able to look back and say, thank goodness we
1415.92	1422.54	 made it through. I have optimistic we will. Well, the curve you′re describing is pretty smooth.
1423.04	1428.42	 It implies that there′s going to be another side to this. But if things keep exponentially changing,
1428.86	1433.92	 there won′t necessarily be that moment because it′ll always feel like it does right now.
1434.32	1440.1	 Well, the technology that this breakthrough with these models and really with training on huge
1440.1	1445.14	 amounts of compute, huge amounts of data, I think it can only go so far. We don′t know the limits
1445.14	1449.52	 of it, but it′s not going to be everything. If you look at people that are trying to study the
1449.52	1453.94	 brain, you know, there′s other things going on there, different kinds of structure and so on.
1454.14	1455.26	 You think we′re running out of data?
1455.88	1461.48	 No, no, I don′t think that′s it. I think that the technique, it′s a very specific technique.
1461.8	1467.34	 That alone I don′t think is going to be sufficient for being the same as humans. I don′t say we
1467.34	1471.3	 could ever do it. Some people do argue that sequence prediction, which is essentially
1471.72	1475.84	 what is driving this whole craze, might be all you need. What do you think about that?
1476.48	1479.4	 Well, it′s certainly all you need for certain tasks. We′re seeing that now. It′s
1479.4	1483.96	 really quite amazing. There is sometimes fine-tuning on the other side, but again,
1484.26	1488.84	 who knows? I personally have been wrong about this particular technology. I think like a lot
1488.84	1492.86	 of people, I just didn′t know how to think in terms of billions of parameters and we′re just
1492.86	1497.76	 not good at that. There were some very ambitious people that just sort of went for it and surprised
1497.76	1503.94	 all of us. I admit it, I did not see this coming and I was surprised by it. We have certainly in
1503.94	1509.68	 the research community, it′s been developing gradually. Word2Vec came along. Going back even
1509.68	1516.02	 farther, again, when I was doing early in the statistical NLP time, people were looking at SVDs,
1516.16	1520.72	 singular value decomposition, and LSA, latent semantic analysis, which is similar in a lot of
1520.72	1525.7	 ways. It was putting words in a matrix, well, words by document matrices and trying to find
1525.8	1531.98	 similarities. Even before that, I was trying to solve the thesaurus or the synonym problem to help
1531.98	1538.12	 with search. In search, you look for cat and it′s really feline and you don′t find anything. Going
1538.12	1541.02	 back to the beginning of our conversation... And you didn′t want users to have to put in
1541.02	1547.0	 every synonym imaginable for a cat just to find text about cats. Well, library catalogs had
1547.0	1549.86	 synonyms in the early days. They weren′t that good, they weren′t dynamic, they didn′t handle
1549.86	1555.3	 new technology and they were hard to use. WordNet came along and developed as a linguistic tool and
1555.3	1560.48	 was the first person to download it, actually, when they had an FTP available. I did work on that and
1560.48	1565.08	 it was like, oh, we can have a thesaurus. But it never worked. Whenever you had automatically
1565.08	1571.04	 recommended terms for a term, some of them were right and some were wrong. That was true of SVD
1571.04	1575.72	 and LSA as well. They worked in some cases, they didn′t work in other cases. It wasn′t until
1575.72	1581.28	 Word2Vec came along and then people actually refined it to have different senses that it
1581.28	1587.8	 actually started to work. I was saying, wow, this actually works and I′ve seen 20 years of this not
1587.8	1593.72	 working. Of course, that kept being refined and being made more sophisticated with the
1593.72	1597.94	 transformers came along and now the really large things. In the research community, it′s been
1597.94	1603.3	 happening gradually. There were a lot of debates about counting versus probabilities and all this.
1604.02	1610.5	 It′s not out of the blue, but I do, again, I admit that in this last year between the
1610.86	1615.7	 combination of the image plus text generation and these language models where the input could be
1615.7	1620.54	 text, we never thought the input could be text and then the output would be all these things.
1620.68	1624.06	 We thought we had to program things. I don′t think the people who developed these models
1624.06	1630.66	 expected that either. I believe it was a surprise to them. It is different now. I don′t think
1630.66	1637.18	 everything is solved. I don′t think it′s AGI, but the tools are much more effective than they used to be.
1637.18	1642.96	 Well, like you said, it′s all about capabilities. It turns out if you teach a very big neural
1642.96	1647.84	 network how to predict the next word on a huge amount of internet text, all these really neat
1647.84	1652.02	 emergent capabilities come into your hands. It couldn′t have been predicted. In fact,
1652.08	1656.66	 no one really thought it would work as well as it does, I′m sure, but it does.
1657.0	1663.66	 I wonder what happens when you teach a model to predict the next image in every YouTube video.
1664.38	1665.3	 What capabilities emerge?
1665.96	1670.02	 Yeah, it′s going to be interesting. It should be much better at generating videos. I guess
1670.02	1674.04	 there′s already work on generating videos. I feel like generating videos is kind of like that
1674.04	1679.62	 unicorn story moment. Remember in the early days of GPT-3 when they were trying to show how great
1679.62	1684.04	 it was? They said, look, you can start the first sentence of a story about something that it
1684.04	1693.64	 definitely has never seen. It was something about unicorns. It could just write a story. It′s
1694.4	1699.74	 where you start with an image and you just say, hey, finish this. Make this a one-minute video
1699.74	1705.52	 from this scene. That′ll happen. Just like with GPT-3, the thing that′s going to blow us away
1705.52	1709.62	 are the things we can′t predict it′ll be able to do. It′s going to have capabilities
1709.62	1710.98	 that just emerge.
1711.56	1715.16	 Well, I have to admit that I was not at all impressed by the unicorn story. In fact,
1715.22	1719.7	 that′s why I was skeptical. I was like, this is clearly cherry-picked and it′s from a fairy
1719.7	1721.52	 tale and you put anything else in. It′s just not useful.
1721.74	1727.58	 Well, when you do NLP, there′s different kinds of tasks. Some tasks are easier to evaluate than
1727.58	1731.78	 others. Like information extraction, did you identify the right that a company is an
1731.78	1737.34	 organization or is it a rock band or whatever? If you are doing search, it′s very hard to know if
1737.34	1741.26	 you have the best ranking in a lot of cases. If you′re doing summarization, there are many
1741.26	1747.2	 legitimate ways to summarize a paper. It′s really hard to evaluate summarization. If you′re
1747.2	1752.14	 generating a story, you can generate almost anything and it′s a story. This is why I was
1752.14	1756.82	 not at all impressed by the unicorn example, but it turned out that actually there was more behind
1756.82	1761.1	 it than the cherry-picked example. Although GPT-3… I wasn′t impressed with GPT-3 myself until the
1761.1	1764.88	 instruct GPT version came out and the thing actually did your bidding.
1765.36	1768.2	 Yeah, well, they improved on it. Yeah, they really improved on it.
1768.46	1773.36	 The problem is initially they were hyping it in ways that weren′t helpful. I know that now
1773.36	1778.18	 they′re being more careful. I mean, open AI. Or maybe they did have more behind the scene. They
1778.18	1781.86	 kind of said, oh, well, we know stuff that you don′t know and we can′t share it. So you want
1781.86	1788.14	 everyone to be able to test things. That′s what happened with the fake blood testing company and
1788.14	1792.52	 all that. It was clear from the beginning it was fraud. So you have to, if you′re going to make
1792.52	1797.68	 big claims, you need to be able to show your cards. Yep. All right. So zooming out a bit,
1797.84	1805.36	 what do you think is going to be the most exciting things to pay attention to on the research side of
1805.36	1809.96	 your fields? You really have more than one field. But I′d love to just hear your thoughts. What′s
1809.96	1815.66	 in your mind these days given this kind of big sea change as you describe it, which I agree.
1816.3	1818.9	 Well, there′s a lot of people doing a lot of stuff. There′s a lot of people really interested
1818.9	1824.82	 in AI safety and AI anti-bias. They′re all very important. I think there′s also a lot of people
1824.82	1828.1	 looking at the AI human interface, which is something I′ve been interested in for a long
1828.1	1833.24	 time. And that′s super important. People doing driving cars, self-driving cars have a bit of a
1833.24	1838.2	 head start, mainly on seeing how hard the problem is. Actually, I had a PhD student at Cecilia
1838.2	1844.48	 Aragon who looked at projecting LIDAR visualizations for helicopter pilots on the screen and how could
1844.48	1849.3	 we make that work and have them not crash? Because this could show them if, say, a squall was ahead
1849.3	1853.96	 and they might potentially crash if they went into it. And we found that the simplest,
1854.12	1857.04	 most bare-bones interface was the very best so that they weren′t distracted.
1857.66	1862.52	 So I′ve always had questions about self-driving cars and that problem of the attention of the
1862.52	1868.54	 driver. And that′s really not solved. And the studies I have seen on automatically generated
1868.54	1873.54	 language and interfaces, even some we′ve done in the Scholarify semantic scholar project,
1873.84	1878.96	 semantic reader project, we don′t have good answers for that. People just start to rely
1878.96	1884.92	 on the automatically generated output. It′s natural. And so that′s a huge problem that
1884.92	1889.7	 needs to be solved. What are some of the ways that we could help people if everyone comes to rely on
1889.7	1895.58	 chat GPT for day-to-day work? What are some of the levers we can pull to help them?
1896.2	1900.82	 I haven′t solved this problem. I mean, it′s certainly good user interface design,
1900.88	1905.48	 understanding people. So HCI shows us how to study people and how they work and how they
1905.48	1911.54	 work with technology. So using HCI methods to deeply study that and in different contexts.
1911.68	1915.86	 It′s different in a medical setting. There′s a colleague that, Ilifar Salehi here at the
1915.86	1920.8	 iSchool at Berkeley, who is looking at machine translation in a medical setting and when
1920.8	1926.32	 information is not translated correctly and how that can adversely impact marginalized communities
1926.32	1930.3	 when the translation isn′t really the right thing and how to get the context right.
1930.76	1936.56	 So I think each setting is probably going to need some specialized research. And furthermore,
1936.96	1941.14	 one of your podcasts is about how do people inject poison, the training data and so on.
1941.26	1944.62	 And so you're going to have to be very careful about attacks like that. It′s not a field that
1944.62	1948.76	 I′m in. Perhaps it will be important to have diversification in the different models so that
1948.76	1953.72	 there′s ways to check them, make sure that they are safe and appropriate for a particular use.
1954.04	1959.9	 I think the techniques of HCI and ethnography really work independent of the context. It′s
1959.9	1965.74	 not AI. People in AI don′t necessarily want to sit down with people, humans, and see their
1965.74	1971.2	 details and what they do and so on. But that′s the only way to have really working systems that
1971.2	1976.96	 are good for society. Yeah, I′ve noticed that there′s this kind of mindset of people who build
1976.96	1982.82	 AI, generally people who build AI systems. It′s the engineering mindset. The more you can take
1982.82	1987.72	 the person out of the equation, the better because I want my development environment to be nice and
1987.72	1991.1	 clean and straightforward and I want to build something that I understand. And as soon as you
1991.1	1996.08	 get people involved, oof, people are complicated. But what you′re saying is you have to include
1996.08	2002.08	 the person. Yeah, and that′s why I′m heartened by the new interest in NLP plus HCI. There′s
2002.08	2005.58	 been workshops I′ve asked to talk at because I′ve been thinking about it for a long time.
2006.06	2011.04	 But it′s true that a lot of people who are making the biggest advances in the NLP AI field are
2011.04	2015.54	 mathematicians or physicists and it′s just not what they think about. They like to think abstract
2015.54	2020.56	 way and they′re brilliant and they′re really improving these systems. But we need teams to
2020.56	2027.26	 work on technology. The one-person band just doesn′t exist in this space. So what would
2027.26	2033.14	 you say to students coming into these fields just now? Has the advice changed at all? It′s hard to
2033.14	2037.34	 know what to say right now. It′s moving so fast. What I say to all students is what are you
2037.34	2042.22	 passionate about? What really interests you? Do that. Don′t do the trendiest thing for its own
2042.22	2048.04	 sake. It′s definitely a big question mark right now for research universities and AI labs and
2048.04	2053.6	 other research groups. If there′s a big microscope that some people have and you don′t, how do you
2053.6	2059.1	 compete? There′s open source effort, things that Hugging Face and others are doing. I think the
2059.1	2062.44	 US government is interested as well in giving everybody a microscope,
2062.88	2067.36	 meaning these large language models and the ability to run them. I think that people are
2067.36	2072.52	 very aware of that issue. But then if you want to do advanced research on this, you get brilliant
2072.52	2077.6	 people like Agent Choi at University of Washington and AI2 that are showing that you can do a lot
2077.6	2082.38	 with much less. You don′t need to have all these parameters and so on. That′s where the university
2082.38	2086.2	 can help. The university people are also going to be looking at how do you save energy. Well,
2086.32	2090.54	 I mean, so is industry. But how do you save energy when you use these? It′s very wasteful right now.
2090.78	2095.1	 These are all great areas for research. Of course, understanding what these models are doing,
2095.3	2099.42	 understanding the mind better, can they help us understand the mind in some way? I′m sure
2099.42	2103.84	 psychologists are thinking about that. There′s work already, I′ve seen work in linguistics on
2103.84	2109.84	 say using GANs and adversarial methods to model linguistics in other species.
2110.52	2115.62	 There′s always more research questions. If you′re interested in being in industry and business,
2115.74	2119.7	 then go do that. If you′re interested in research, then find a problem that just really
2119.7	2122.0	 interests you because that′s how you can finish your PhD.
2122.56	2127.64	 And just to bring it to a close, what′s coming up in your life that listeners might be
2127.64	2132.16	 interested to know about? Is there a project or an event on the horizon?
2132.56	2136.24	 Well, I think the project that I′m most excited about is working with my PhD student,
2136.34	2141.08	 Chase Stokes, on understanding this interaction between language and visualization. We just
2141.08	2147.94	 finished a paper that we submitted on if you place text on a chart and the goal of the chart is to
2149.38	2153.1	 predict how text impacts that prediction. Like who′s going to win an election by looking at
2153.1	2157.52	 this chart? And we actually found surprisingly that the text did not influence the prediction
2157.52	2162.88	 all that much. In this case, where people relied more on the visual input. But in another study we
2162.88	2168.04	 did where it was more what are you taking away information-wise, then the way the text was used
2168.04	2173.0	 did have an influence. So what we really need to do is understand this interplay more. I′m just
2173.0	2176.78	 very excited about that topic. I know it′s kind of a niche topic, but it′s what interests me.
2176.8	2183.5	 Oh, far from niche. We′re going into a very momentous political year and these little
2183.5	2188.94	 interactions between a person and a piece of information can have massive, massive effects.
2189.28	2191.6	 You′re right. We don′t really understand how they work, do we?
2192.0	2195.68	 No. I like to work in topics where there isn′t a lot of work at that time,
2195.94	2199.86	 like search interfaces and so on. And then when it becomes popular, I tend to move on. I think
2199.86	2203.78	 I can′t compete or something. So I have to find a new thing that nobody′s thinking about.
2203.78	2206.88	 Uh-oh. I might have just ruined your picnic. Now everyone′s going to get interested in
2206.88	2208.16	 language and visualization.
2208.54	2212.44	 No, no. I want that. In fact, the keynote I gave, I think, helped with that. So I want
2212.44	2213.48	 people to be working on this.
2213.88	2215.74	 Marty, thanks so much for talking with us.
