Are LLMs Overhyped or Underappreciated? with Marti Hearst - #626
Today we’re joined by Marti Hearst, Professor at UC Berkeley. In our conversation with Marti, we explore the intricacies of AI language models and their usefulness in improving efficiency but also their potential for spreading misinformation. Marti expresses skepticism about whether these models truly have cognition compared to the nuance of the human brain. We discuss the intersection of language and visualization and the need for specialized research to ensure safety and appropriateness for specific uses. We also delve into the latest tools and algorithms such as Copilot and Chat GPT, which enhance programming and help in identifying comparisons, respectively. Finally, we discuss Marti’s long research history in search and her breakthrough in developing a standard interaction that allows for finding items on websites and library catalogs.
